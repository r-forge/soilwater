Description: The package implements commonly used functions for soil water retention 
    (water content = f(matrix potential)) and soil hydraulic conductivity (hydraulic 
    conductivity K = f(matrix potential), or = f(water content)). The functions for 
    for soil water retention implemented are: van Genuchten 1980; Brooks & Corey 1964; 
    Campbell 1974. The functions for soil hydraulic conductivity implemented are: Mualem 
    1976; Brooks & Corey 1964; Campbell 1974. NB: The package soilwaterptf 
    contains pedotransfer function for estimating the parameters of these functions 
    from basic soil properties (valid for european soils).
