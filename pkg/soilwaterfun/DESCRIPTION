Description: The package implements commonly used functions for soil water retention (water content = f(matrix potential)) and soil hydraulic conductivity (hydraulic conductivity K = f(matrix potential), or = f(water content)). The functions for for soil water retention implemented are: van Genuchten 1980; Brooks & Corey 1964; Campbell 1974. The functions for soil hydraulic conductivity implemented are: Mualem 1976; Brooks & Corey 1964; Campbell 1974. NB: The package soilwaterptf contains pedotransfer function for estimating the parameters of these functions from basic soil properties (valid for european soils).
