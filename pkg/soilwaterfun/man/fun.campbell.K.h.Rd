\title{Campbell 1974 function for hydraulic conductivity, K(h) }
\description{Function that calculates soil hydraulic conductivity K after 
Campbell 1974 equation, as a function of h. 
This uses Campbell K(theta) equation presented in fun.campbell.K.theta(), 
but theta is here replaced by h, using Campbell simplification 
of Brooks & Corey water retention's curve.
The model is: K = Ks * ((h/h.a)^-(2+3/b.par)) 
The advantage of Campbell's model is that it uses the same 
b.par parameter for both the water retention curve and 
the hydraulic conductivity. 'm' parameter in Brooks & Corey's 
model is equal to 2+3/b.par.}
\usage{
fun.campbell.K.h(h, h.a, Ks, b.par)
}
\arguments{
  \item{h}{Vector of numerical. Matrix potential of the soil, in [m]. 
Values should be negative (suction).}
  \item{h.a}{Single numerical. Matrix potential at the air entry point [m3.m-3]}
  \item{Ks}{Single numerical. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity. In 
length unit per unit of time [L.T-1] (the unit in which K is 
resturned is the same as the unit in which Ks is given). }
  \item{b.par}{Single numerical. Campbell 'b' (shape) parameter, same as in 
fun.campbell.theta.h().}
}

\value{Returns a vector of numericals, K [L.T-1] for each h 
values provided.}
