\title{Brooks & Corey 1964 function for hydraulic conductivity, K(h) }
\description{Brooks and Corey 1964 model for soil hydraulic conductivity. 
The model is: K / Ks = (h/hA)^-m when h < hA 
and K = Ks when hA <= h < 0}
\usage{
fun.brooks.corey.K.h(h,
hA,
Ks,
m)
}
\arguments{
  \item{h}{Vector of numerical. Pressure head of the soil, in [m]. Matrix 
potential values will also work, as in practice abs(h) is used.}
  \item{hA}{Single numerical. Pressure head at the air entry point [m3.m-3]}
  \item{Ks}{Single numerical. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity. In 
length unit per unit of time [L.T-1] (the unit in which K is 
resturned is the same as the unit in which Ks is given). }
  \item{m}{Single numerical. Brook & Corey m (shape) parameter [-] 
(depend on the pore size distribution. approx. from 3 to 11). }
}

\value{Returns a vector of numericals, K values [L.T-1] (same unit as 
Ks) for each h values provided.}
