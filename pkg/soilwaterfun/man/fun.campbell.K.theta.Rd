\title{Campbell 1974 function for hydraulic conductivity, K(theta) }
\description{Function that calculates soil hydraulic conductivity K after 
Campbell 1974 equation, as a function of theta.
The model is: K = Ks * ((theta/thetaS)^(2*bPar + 3)) 
The advantage of Campbell's model is that it uses the same 
bPar parameter for both the water retention curve and 
the hydraulic conductivity.}
\usage{fun.campbell.K.theta(theta, thetaS, Ks, bPar)}
\arguments{
  \item{theta}{Vector of numerical. Soil water content(s) in [m3.m-3].}
  \item{thetaS}{Single numerical. Soil saturated water content [m3.m-3].}
  \item{Ks}{Single numerical. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity. In 
length unit per unit of time [L.T-1] (the unit in which K is 
resturned is the same as the unit in which Ks is given). }
  \item{bPar}{Single numerical. Campbell 'b' (shape) parameter, same as in 
fun.campbell.theta.h().}
}

\value{Returns a vector of numericals, K [L.T-1] for each theta 
values provided.}
