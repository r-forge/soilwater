CHANGES IN VERSION <= 1.0.3

   2011/10/27 Added a vignette to the package;
   
   ?          Create an 'all in one' function for Wosten PTFs;
   
   2010/11/01 Benchmarked soilwaterptf:::ptf.wosten calculations 
              agaisnt an excel spreadsheet made by Henk Wosten 
              to check that the results were (almost) identical.
   
   2010/11/01 Added an error when the user tries to calculates 
              Wosten et al. 1999 PTFs whith 0 for silt or om 
              or bulk density. The functions contains ln(silt) 
              and/or ln(om) and/or ln(bulk density) that does not 
              work with zeros.
   
   2010/11/01 Added Wösten et al. 1999 classes PTFs (physical 
              properties calculated from texture class instead 
              of clay silt sand, etc.)
   
   2010/11/01 Corrected an important bug: Wösten kSat was reported 
              to be calculated in [mm.h-1], while it was in 
              fact [cm.day-1]. Sorry for the inconvenience.
   
   2010/08/13 Version 1.0 of the package. Documented.
   
   2010/09/08 Changed the name of the functions options to achieve 
              a more uniform name convention (necessary for 
              fortran integration)
